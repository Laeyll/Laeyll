Here we can clearly see there is different part like the time part, the remote_ip, ...
* how json should look like 
it will look like this :
```json
{
      "time" : "-------",
      "remote-ip" : "------",
      "request" : "------",
      "response" : "-------",
      "bytes" : "------",
      "referrer" : "------",
      "system_agent" : "------",
      "user_agent" : "------",
}
```
here we can see the different part we talked before, the whole logs will be list like that.
if their is nothing in the log there will just be a -
```json
{
       "bytes" : "-",
}
```
* statistic
