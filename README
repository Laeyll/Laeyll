### usage 
* logs 
logs must look like that or the program might don't run 
```
83.149.9.216 - - [17/May/2015:10:05:03 +0000] "GET /presentations/logstash-monitorama-2013/images/kibana-search.png HTTP/1.1" 200 203023 "http://semicomplete.com/presentations/logstash-monitorama-2013/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/32.0.1700.77 Safari/537.36"
```
Here we can clearly see there is different part like the time part, the remote_ip, ...
* how json should look like 
it will look like this :
```json
{
      "time" : "-------",
      "remote-ip" : "------",
      "request" : "------",
      "response" : "-------",
      "bytes" : "------",
      "referrer" : "------",
      "system_agent" : "------",
      "user_agent" : "------",
}
```
here we can see the different part we talked before, the whole logs will be list like that.
if their is nothing in the log there will just be a -
```json
{
       "bytes" : "-",
}
```
* dump a file into a json file
 ```json
python '.\Projet_python_LIM_LACHERAY_1A.py' --dump test.txt_example.txt
```
so --dump is the option then the name of the file to dumb and how you want the json file to be named
* statistic
we have done many statistic that we think usefull so here a exemple of how to use it
 ```json
python .\Projet_python_LIM_LACHERAY_1A.py --ip 	log.json
 ```
so the --ip is the option and it will show whitch ip come the more often  it can also be 
 ```json
--mobile
```
to show number of mobile that are used 
 ```json
--error
```
to show ip that make error (to much error can be usefull for security)
 ```json
--hours
```
to show hours sorted by popularity 
 ```json
--bots
```
to show differents bots 
### add on 
you can add graph to make stat more visible 
or a graphic interface
